Developer CMD Starter Suite
==================================
Developer CMD Starter Suite, also known as DCSS, is a suite of basic system commands and scans that can be executed with a single click or double-click of a button. The suite includes various features, such as a CHKDSK scan of your primary drive (C:), an SFC quick scan, and more, that eliminate the need for manually typing basic commands and help you get started quickly.

All commands in DCSS are in BATCH format, which makes it possible to automate them and copy-paste their code into larger programs.

Instructions
=================================
To use DCSS, you need to download the source code as the suite is not a standalone software, but a collection of CMD commands.

Here are the steps to use DCSS:

Download the entire source code
Run the BATCH files you want to execute. If any file needs administrator rights to run, it will be marked with "_admin".
Each file is named after the command it executes.
