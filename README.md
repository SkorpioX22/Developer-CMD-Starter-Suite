Developer CMD Starter Suite

[DCSS]

DCSS allows you to run basic system commands and scans with a click (or double-click) of a button. It includes a CHKDSK of your main drive (C:), an SFC quick scan, and many other features that help you get on your way without the delay of typing basic commands.

They are all in BATCH format, so you can even automate these basic commands, and copy and paste their code into a bigger program!

Instuctions:
=============================

Download the code. You can only obtain tthe suite if you download the entire code, as the DCSS is NOT a software, but a suite of CMD commands.

Run the BATCH files you want. If they need to be ran as Administrator, they will be marked "_admin".
Each file will be named to what they do (obviously).


Extras:
